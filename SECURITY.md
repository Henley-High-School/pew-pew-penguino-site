If reporting a Security Issue which isn't hosted on one of our repositorys (**Any owned by Henley-High-School**) or **penguinogame.me** please email their Security Team.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability or issue, please report it immediately. Follow these steps to ensure a swift and efficient resolution:

* **Report Directly:** Send a detailed description of the vulnerability to our security team via email at hello@penguinogame.me. Include steps to reproduce the issue, potential impact, and any relevant screenshots or logs.

* **Avoid Public Disclosure:** Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed. This helps us manage and mitigate the risk effectively.

* **Follow Up:** If you do not receive a response within a reasonable timeframe, please follow up with us.

## Security Best Practices
To maintain a secure repository, we follow these best practices:

* **Code Review:** All pull requests are reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging. This helps identify and address potential security issues early.

* **Access Control:** Access to sensitive data and repository settings is restricted to authorized personnel only. Use of two-factor authentication (2FA) is required for all contributors.

* **Dependencies:** We regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions and monitor for known vulnerabilities.

* **Secrets Management:** Secrets and sensitive information are never stored in the repository. Use environment variables and secure storage solutions for managing secrets.

* **Security Audits:** Periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted to identify and mitigate potential risks.
